      "The novel is set in the reign of old king henry vi (1422–1461, 1470–1471) and during the wars of the roses (1455–1487). the story begins with the tunstall moat house alarm bell, rung to summon recruits for its absent lord sir daniel brackley, to join the battle of risingham; at which the outlaw fellowship known as the black arrow begins to strike with its four black arrows for the four black hearts of brackley and three of his retainers: nicholas appleyard, bennet hatch, and sir oliver oates, the parson. the rhyme posted in explanation of this attack, makes the protagonist richard ('dick') shelton, ward of sir daniel, curious about the death of his father sir harry shelton. having been dispatched to kettley, where sir daniel was quartered, and sent to tunstall moat house by return dispatch, he falls in with a fugitive, joanna sedley, disguised as a boy with the alias of john matcham: an heiress kidnapped by sir daniel to obtain guardianship over her and to retain his control over richard by marrying her to him.\n",
      "as they travel through tunstall forest, joanna tries to persuade dick to turn against sir daniel in sympathy with the black arrow outlaws, whose camp they discover near the ruins of grimstone manor. the next day they are met in the forest by sir daniel himself, disguised as a leper and returning to the moat house after his side was defeated at risingham. dick and joanna then follow sir daniel to the moat house. here dick confirms that sir daniel is the murderer of his father, and escapes injured from the moat house. he is rescued by the outlaws of the black arrow.\n",
      "the second half of the novel, books 3–5, tells how dick rescues joanna from sir daniel with the help of both the black arrow fellowship and the yorkist army led by richard crookback, the future richard iii of england. it centres on shoreby, where the lancastrian forces are entrenched. robert louis stevenson inserts seafaring adventure in chapters 4–6 of book 3, wherein dick and the outlaws steal a ship and attempt a seaside rescue of joanna. they are unsuccessful, and after joanna is moved to sir daniel's main quarters in shoreby, dick visits her in the guise of a franciscan friar. stevenson, the populariser of the tales of the arabian nights, has dick tell the tale of ali baba and the forty thieves in book 4, chapter 6 to help him escape from the ruined sea captain arblaster, whose ship dick and the outlaws had stolen.\n",
      "while shadowing sir daniel, dick and the outlaws encounter another group of spies interested in joanna. after a skirmish in which the outlaws prevail, dick finds that he has conquered joanna's lawful guardian, lord foxham, who promises to give joanna to dick in marriage after a contemplated seaside rescue. there is irony in foxham scolding dick, who is nobly born, for consorting with outlaws when the outlaws are recruited in dick and foxham's plans to rescue joanna. wounded in the failed seaside rescue, foxham writes letters of recommendation for dick to richard crookback, whom dick must find on the outskirts of shoreby.\n",
      "richard crookback, duke of gloucester, makes his appearance in book 5. as dick is leaving shoreby he sees crookback holding his own against seven or eight lancastrian assailants, and assists his victory. dick's accurate knowledge of the lancastrian forces in shoreby aid crookback in winning the battle that he wages later that day. dick is also successful as one of crookback's commanders. crookback knights dick on the field of battle and, following their victory, gives him fifty horsemen to pursue sir daniel, who has escaped shoreby with joanna. dick succeeds in rescuing joanna, but loses his men in the process. he, joanna, and alicia risingham travel to holywood where he and joanna are married. in this way he keeps his initial pledge to joanna to convey her safely to holywood.\n",
      "in the early morning of his wedding day dick encounters a fugitive sir daniel trying to enter holywood seaport to escape to france or burgundy. because it is his wedding day, dick does not want to soil his hands with sir daniel's blood, so he simply bars his way by challenging him either to hand-to-hand combat or alerting a yorkist perimeter patrol. sir daniel retreats, but is shot by ellis duckworth (the outlaws' captain) with the last black arrow. thereafter sir richard and lady shelton live in tunstall moat house untroubled by the rest of the wars of the roses. they provide for both captain arblaster and the outlaw will lawless by pensioning them and settling them in tunstall hamlet, where lawless does a volte face by returning to the franciscan order, taking the name, brother honestus.\n",

      "during his stay at the hospital, he is told that he will be hanged. also at the hospital, he meets elsie stoneman, whose picture he has been carrying; she is working there as a nurse. elsie takes cameron's mother, who had traveled to washington to tend her son, to see abraham lincoln, and mrs. cameron persuades the president to pardon ben. when lincoln is assassinated at ford's theatre, his conciliatory postwar policy expires with him. in the wake of the president's death, austin stoneman and other radical republicans are determined to punish the south, employing harsh measures that griffith depicts as having been typical of the reconstruction era.[16]\n",

      "the film concludes with a double wedding as margaret cameron marries phil stoneman and elsie stoneman marries ben cameron. the masses are shown oppressed by a giant warlike figure who gradually fades away. the scene shifts to another group finding peace under the image of jesus christ. the penultimate title is: dare we dream of a golden day when the bestial war shall rule no more. but instead — the gentle prince in the hall of brotherly love in the city of peace.\n"

      "a thoughtful contrast is made between the carpenter brother and his mother. the mother reads the story of moses and emphasizes strict obedience and fear of god. the carpenter, however, reads from the new testament story of jesus's healing of lepers. his emphasis is on a loving and forgiving god. the film also shows the mother's strict lawful morality to be flawed in comparison to her son's version.\n",
      "danny becomes a corrupt contractor who builds a church with shoddy concrete, pocketing the money saved and becoming very rich. one day, his mother comes to visit him at his work site, but the walls are becoming unstable due to the shaking of heavy trucks on nearby roads. one of the walls collapses on top of the mother, killing her. in her dying breath, she tells danny that it is her fault for teaching him to fear god, when she should have taught him love.\n",
      "this sends danny on a downward spiral as he attempts to right his wrongs and clear his conscience, but he only gets into more trouble. to make money, he steals pearls from his mistress, and when she fights back, he kills her. he attempts to flee to mexico on a motorboat, but rough weather sends him off course and he crashes into a rocky island, where he is presumably killed.\n",
      "throughout the film, the visual motif of the tablets of the commandments appears in the sets, with a particular commandment appearing on them when it is relevant to the story.\n"

      "Harold meadows (lloyd) is a tailor's apprentice for his uncle in little bend, california. he is so shy around women that he can barely speak to them (to stop his stuttering, his uncle has to blow a whistle). despite this, harold writes a how to book for young men entitled the secret of making love, detailing how to woo different types of young women, such as the vampire and the flapper (in scenes that parodied two other popular films of the time, trifling women and flaming youth[citation needed]), and takes a train to see a publisher in los angeles.\n",
      "the same day, rich young mary buckingham (ralston) boards the same train after her automobile breaks down in little bend. no dogs are allowed aboard, so she hides her pomeranian under her shawl, but her pet jumps off as the train pulls away. harold rescues her dog and helps mary hide it from the conductor. she sees his manuscript, so he starts telling her about his book, overcoming his stuttering in his enthusiasm. they become so absorbed in each other that neither realizes that the train has reached its final destination and everyone else has departed. upon returning home, mary rejects the latest in a string of marriage proposals from persistent suitor ronald devore, a self-centered rich man who is almost twice mary's age and who harbors no true feelings for her, but merely wants her as a trophy wife.\n",
      "after her car is repaired, mary intentionally detours through little bend repeatedly, hoping to see harold again. on one such trip, ronald is also along for the ride, and his unwanted attentions cause mary to swerve and get her car stuck near the outskirts of little bend. while ronald walks back to town for a tow, mary goes for a walk and happens to reunite with harold. after telling mary about the remainder of his book, harold informs her that he is going to see the publisher, roger thornby, in a few days to deliver a new chapter that will be about her. they agree to meet again afterward. meanwhile, ronald runs into a middle-aged woman who asks if he is finally going to introduce her to his family, but he stalls, then rides away in the tow-vehicle.\n",
      "mr. thornby's professional readers find harold's book hilariously absurd, so he rejects it. without any royalty money, harold figures he cannot ask mary to marry him. so he pretends that he was only using her as part of his research. heartbroken, mary impulsively agrees to marry ronald. afterward, though, one of mr. thornby's senior employees convinces him that, if the staff liked the book so much, there must be a market for it, so thornby decides to publish it as the boob's diary.\n",
      "a few days later, a depressed harold gets a letter from the publisher, but just rips it up without opening it, assuming that it is a rejection notice. fortunately, his uncle notices that one of the scraps is part of an advance royalty check for $3,000; the accompanying letter states that the book will be published as a comedy. at first, harold is outraged, but then he realizes that he can propose to mary after all. however, when he sees a newspaper headline announcing mary and ronald's wedding that same day at her family's estate, he gives up. by chance, the same woman whom ronald had met a few days earlier walks in and, seeing the newspaper story, tearfully exclaims that she is ronald's wife. as proof, she shows harold a locket with the couple's wedding portrait and the engraved words to my wife that ronald had given her two years earlier.\n",
      "harold embarks on a frenzied headlong dash, involving bootleggers, car chases and multiple changes of vehicle (from missing the train to various cars to a trolley to a police motorcycle to a horse-drawn wagon to horseback), through the countryside and along the crowded streets of culver city and los angeles. he bursts in just in time, but he cannot stop stuttering long enough to expose ronald's intended bigamy. so harold simply carries mary off. when they are alone, he tells her about ronald's secret and shows her the locket. mary gets harold to propose (with an assist from a passing mail carrier's whistle), and she accepts.\n",

      "trina's bitten fingers become infected and have to be amputated. to earn money she becomes a janitor at a children's school. she withdraws the $5,000 from the bank to keep it close to her, eventually spreading it on her bed so she can sleep on it. mcteague then returns, having spent the money he took, and asks trina for more. the following day mcteague confronts trina at the school. after a heated argument mcteague beats trina to death and steals her $5,000.\n",
      "now an outlaw, mcteague returns to placer county and teams up with a prospector named cribbens. headed towards death valley, they find a large quantity of quartz and plan to become millionaires. before they can begin mining, mcteague senses danger and flees into death valley with a single horse, the remaining money and one water jug. several marshals pursue him, joined by schouler. schouler wants to catch mcteague personally and rides into death valley alone.\n",

      "von stroheim's original edit contained two main sub-plots that were later cut. the point of these sub-plots was to contrast two possible outcomes of trina and mcteague's life together. the first depicted the lives of the junkman zerkow and maria miranda macapa, the young mexican woman who collects junk for zerkow and sold trina the lottery ticket. maria often talks about her imaginary solid gold dining set with zerkow, who becomes obsessed by it. eventually, believing she has riches hidden away, zerkow marries her. he often asks about it, but she gives a different answer each time he mentions it. zerkow does not believe her and becomes obsessed with prying the truth from her. he murders her and after having lost his mind, leaps into san francisco bay.\n",
      "the second sub-plot depicts the lives of charles w. grannis and miss anastasia baker. grannis and baker are two elderly boarders who share adjoining rooms in the apartment complex where trina and mcteague live. throughout their time at the apartment complex, they have not met. they both sit close to their adjoining wall and listen to the other for company, so they know almost everything about each other. they finally meet and cannot hide their long-time feelings for each other. when they reveal their love, grannis admits he has $5,000, making him just as rich as trina. but this makes little difference to them. eventually, they marry and a door connects their rooms.\n",

      "meanwhile, cesar encounters dolores (mary astor), daughter of his father's old friend, general de muro (jack mcdonald), as she poses for a sculptor. it is love at first sight. but sebastian, who comes from a poor family, has set his sights on dolores and her family's wealth, and is determined to win her. later, the archduke invites cesar to paint the town, with sebastian as their duenna. in a local tavern the archduke offends the patrons, all seeming ruffians, by flirting with the dancer. sebastian contrives his and the duke's escape, but locks cesar in the tavern to defend himself against the cutthroats. in the carriage that takes them away from what he is sure will be cesar's death, sebastian declares he has a meeting with dolores. the archduke invites himself along. while sebastian asks the general for his daughter's hand, the archduke sees dolores serenaded by cesar, who escaped (easily) and even acquired a guitar as a souvenir. seeing the reactions of the young couple, the archduke knows cesar has won dolores's heart.\n",

      "in the card room, the archduke declares that sebastian is as unlucky at cards as he is in love. franque tiptoes in, and tells the archduke that he saw cesar and dolores kissing: surely they will be married now. the archduke summons cesar to congratulate him, to the horror of sebastian. when he enters, cesar is offended at the impropriety of this news, and learns that the source was fabrique. such bad manners should not go unpunished. he informs the archduke that someone here doesn't belong, and asks if he should remove him. archduke paul nods, and cesar pulls fabrique out of the room by tugging his nose.\n",
      "the archduke continues to taunt sebastian, a foolish move when sebastian, enraged by jealousy, pulls his sword and stabs the archduke before he realizes what he has done. he hides when cesar, hearing something, enters, then strikes cesar unconscious. he frames him for the archduke's murder, then casually leaves. with his last dying energy, the archduke pulls a playing card off the table and writes on it: sebastian assassinated me. archduke paul.\n",

      "after months of mourning over cesar, dolores is pushed to marry sebastian. just as she is about to sign the marriage contract with sebastian, cesar appears at the window. he is alive! the queen orders cesar’s arrest. the best man to find him: that one-eyed ferret, colonel matsado (albert macquarrie). but when matsado stops at a country inn on his way into the city, cesar waylays him, steals his uniform, and impersonates him. back in the city cesar as matsado pretends to beat his (now fabrique's) old manservant robledo (charles stevens) for information on cesar's whereabouts, then convinces fabrique to accompany him to the ruins where cesar has been living these past months. there he is determined to find what hold fabrique has on sebastian.\n",
      "in a whirlwind finish, sebastian and the real matsado track cesar to his lair, as do his father, zorro (fairbanks), who with the mute faithful family servant bernardo (tote du crow), has sailed from california to spain to help. on the way to the ruins they pass dolores and her mother along the same road. finally, as all gather at the ruins, zorro and don q battle the soldiers, fabrique confesses, sebastian is beaten, de muro recognizes his old friend, the villains are arrested, and cesar and dolores reunited.\n",

      "at their campsite at the base of the plateau, the explorers are shocked when a large rock falls, sent their way by an apeman perched on top of an overhead ledge. as the crew look up to see their attacker, challenger spies overhead a pteranodon (mistakenly calling it a pterodactylus) killing and eating a young toxodon which proves that the statements in maple white's diary are true. leaving zambo and austin at the camp, they cross a chasm onto the plateau by cutting down a tree and using it as a bridge, but it is knocked over by a brontosaurus, leaving them trapped.\n",
      "the explorers witness various life-and-death struggles between the prehistoric beasts of the plateau. an allosaurus attacks an edmontosaurus, and knocks it into a bog. the allosaurus then attacks, and is driven off by a triceratops. eventually, the allosaurus makes its way to the campsite and attacks the exploration party. it is finally driven off by ed who tosses a torch into its mouth. convinced that the camp is not safe, ed climbs a tree to look for a new location, but is attacked by the apeman. roxton succeeds in shooting the apeman, but the creature is merely wounded and escapes before he can finish him off. meanwhile, an agathaumas is attacked by the allosaurus, and gores it to death. suddenly, a tyrannosaurus attacks and kills the agathaumas, along with an unfortunate pteranodon.\n",
      "the explorers then make preparations to live on the plateau potentially indefinitely. a catapult is constructed and during a search for maple white, roxton finds his remains, confirming his death. it is at this time that ed confesses his love for paula and the two are unofficially wed by summerlee who used to be a minister.\n",
      "shortly afterwards, as the paleontologists are observing the brontosaurus, an allosaurus attacks it and the brontosaurus falls off the edge of the plateau, becoming trapped in a mud bank at the base of the plateau. soon afterwards, a volcano erupts causing a mass stampede among the giant creatures of the lost world. the crew is saved when paula's pet monkey jocko climbs up the plateau carrying a rope. the crew use the rope to pull up a rope ladder constructed by zambo and austin and then climb down.\n",
      "as ed makes his descent, he is again attacked by the apeman who pulls the rope ladder. the apeman is again shot and finally killed by roxton. they discover the brontosaurus that had been pushed off the plateau had landed softly in the mud of the river, trapped but still alive, and challenger manages to bring it back to london, as he wants to put it on display as proof of his story.\n",
      "however, while being unloaded from the ship it escapes and causes havoc until it reaches tower bridge, where its massive weight causes a collapse, and it swims down the river thames. challenger is morose as the creature leaves. ed discovers that the love he left in london has married in his absence, allowing him and paula to be together. roxton morosely but gallantly hides his love for paula as paula and ed leave together, while two passersby note: that's sir john roxton—sportsman.\n"

      "at the height of the most prosperous season in the opera's history, the management suddenly resign. as they leave, they tell the new managers of the opera ghost, a phantom who asks for opera box #5, among other things. the new managers laugh it off as a joke, but the old management leaves troubled.\n",
      "after the performance, the ballerinas are disturbed by the sight of a mysterious man in a fez (arthur edmund carewe), who dwells in the cellars. arguing whether or not he is the phantom, they decide to ask joseph buquet, a stagehand who has actually seen the ghost's face. buquet describes a ghastly sight of a living skeleton to the girls, who are then startled by a shadow cast on the wall. the antics of stagehand florine papillon (snitz edwards) do not amuse joseph's brother, simon (gibson gowland), who chases him off. meanwhile, mme. carlotta (virginia pearson), the prima donna of the paris grand opera, barges into the managers' office enraged. she has received a letter from the phantom, demanding that christine sing the role of marguerite the following night, threatening dire consequences if his demands are not met. christine is in her dressing room at that moment, speaking to a phantom voice (which the audience sees as a shadow on a wall behind the dressing room.) the voice warns her that she will take carlotta's place on wednesday and that she is to think only of her career and her master.\n",
      "the following day, in a garden near the opera house, raoul meets christine and asks her to reconsider his offer. christine admits that she has been tutored by a divine voice, the spirit of music, and that it is now impossible to stop her career. raoul tells her that he thinks someone is playing a joke on her, and she storms off in anger.\n",
      "wednesday evening, carlotta is ill and christine takes her place in the opera. during the performance, the managers go to box 5 to see exactly who has taken it. the keeper of the box does not know who it is, as she has never seen his face. the two managers enter the box and are startled to see a shadowy figure seated there. they run out of the box and compose themselves, but when they enter the box again, the person is gone. in her next performance, christine reaches her triumph during the finale and receives a standing ovation from the audience. when raoul visits her in her dressing room, she pretends not to recognize him, because unbeknownst to those in the room, the phantom voice is present. meanwhile, simon buquet finds the body of his brother, joseph, hanging by the strangler's noose and vows vengeance. raoul spends the evening outside her door, and after the others have left, just as he is about to enter, he hears the voice within the room. he overhears the voice make his intentions to christine: soon, christine, this spirit will take form and will demand your love! when christine leaves her room alone, raoul breaks in to find it empty. carlotta receives another discordant note from the phantom. once again, it demands that she take ill and let christine have her part. the managers also get a note, reiterating that if christine does not sing, they will present faust in a house with a curse on it.\n",
      "the following evening, despite the phantom's warnings, a defiant carlotta appears as marguerite. at first, the performance goes well, but soon the phantom's curse takes its effect, backstage, causing the great crystal chandelier to fall down onto the audience. christine runs to her dressing room and is entranced by a mysterious voice through a secret door behind the mirror, descending, in a dream-like sequence, semi-conscious on horseback by a winding staircase into the lower depths of the opera. she is then taken by gondola over a subterranean lake by the masked phantom into his lair. the phantom introduces himself as erik and declares his love; christine faints, so erik carries her to a suite fabricated for her comfort. the next day, when she awakens, she finds a note from erik telling her that she is free to come and go as she pleases, but that she must never look behind his mask. in the next room, the phantom is playing his composition, don juan triumphant. christine's curiosity gets the better of her, and she sneaks up behind the phantom and tears off his mask, revealing his hideously deformed face. enraged, the phantom makes his plans to hold her prisoner known. in an attempt to plead to him, he excuses her to visit her world one last time, with the condition that she never sees her lover again.\n",
      "released from the underground dungeon, christine makes a rendezvous at the annual masked-ball, which is graced with the phantom in the guise of the 'red-death' from the edgar allan poe short story of the same name. raoul finds christine and they flee to the roof of the opera house, where she tells him everything that followed the chandelier crash. however, an unseen jealous phantom perching on the statue of apollo overhears them. raoul plans to whisk christine safely away to london following the next performance. as they leave the roof, the mysterious man with the fez approaches them. aware that the phantom is waiting downstairs, he leads christine and raoul to another exit.\n",
      "the following evening, raoul meets christine in her dressing room. she has heard the voice of the phantom, who has revealed that he knows their plans. raoul has arranged for a carriage and reassures her nothing will go wrong. during the performance, the phantom kidnaps christine off the stage during a blackout. raoul rushes to christine's dressing room, and meets the man in the fez, who reveals himself to be inspector ledoux, a secret policeman who has been studying erik's moves as the phantom since he escaped as a prisoner from devil's island. ledoux reveals the secret door in christine's room and the two men enter the catacombs of the opera house in an attempt to rescue christine. instead, they fall into the phantom's dungeon, a torture room of his design. philippe has also found his way into the catacombs looking for his brother, and a clanging alarm alerts the phantom to his presence in a canoe on the lake. phillipe is drowned by erik, who returns to find the two men in the torture chamber. turning a switch, the phantom subjects the two prisoners to intense heat; the two manage to escape the chamber by opening a door in the floor as they are about to perish. in the chamber below, the phantom shuts a gate, locking them in with barrels full of gunpowder.\n",
      "the phantom gives christine a choice of two levers: one shaped like a scorpion and the other like a grasshopper. one of them will save raoul's life, but at the cost of christine marrying erik, while the other will blow up the barrels in the chamber raoul and ledoux are trapped in, in effect destroying the opera house and killing them all. christine picks the scorpion, but it is a trick by the phantom to save raoul and ledoux from being killed by drowning them. christine begs the phantom to save raoul, promising him anything in return, even becoming his wife. at the last second, the phantom opens a trapdoor in his floor through which raoul and ledoux are saved.\n",
      "a mob, led by simon, infiltrates the phantom's lair. as the clanging alarm sounds and the mob approaches, the phantom attempts to flee with christine in the carriage meant for raoul and christine. while raoul saves christine, the phantom is pursued and killed by a mob, who throw him into the river seine to finally drown. in a brief epilogue, raoul and christine are shown on their honeymoon in viroflay.\n",

      "back at the family home jack left long ago, the elder rabinowitz instructs a young student in the traditional cantorial art. jack appears and tries to explain his point of view, and his love of modern music, but the appalled cantor banishes him: i never want to see you again — you jazz singer! as he leaves, jack makes a prediction: i came home with a heart full of love, but you don't want to understand. some day you'll understand, the same as mama does.\n",
      "two weeks after jack's expulsion from the family home and 24 hours before opening night of april follies on broadway, jack's father falls gravely ill. jack is asked to choose between the show and duty to his family and faith: in order to sing the kol nidre for yom kippur in his father's place, he will have to miss the big premiere.\n",
      "that evening, the eve of yom kippur, yudleson tells the jewish elders, for the first time, we have no cantor on the day of atonement. lying in his bed, weak and gaunt, cantor rabinowitz tells sara that he cannot perform on the most sacred of holy days: my son came to me in my dreams—he sang kol nidre so beautifully. if he would only sing like that tonight—surely he would be forgiven.\n",
      "as jack prepares for a dress rehearsal by applying blackface makeup, he and mary discuss his career aspirations and the family pressures they agree he must resist. sara and yudleson come to jack's dressing room to plea for him to come to his father and sing in his stead. jack is torn. he delivers his blackface performance (mother of mine, i still have you), and sara sees her son onstage for the first time. she has a tearful revelation: here he belongs. if god wanted him in his house, he would have kept him there. he's not my boy anymore—he belongs to the whole world now.\n",
      "afterward, jack returns to the rabinowitz home. he kneels at his father's bedside and the two converse fondly: my son—i love you. sara suggests that it may help heal his father if jack takes his place at the yom kippur service. mary arrives with the producer, who warns jack that he'll never work on broadway again if he fails to appear on opening night. jack can't decide. mary challenges him: were you lying when you said your career came before everything? jack is unsure if he even can replace his father: i haven't sung kol nidre since i was a little boy. his mother tells him, do what is in your heart, jakie—if you sing and god is not in your voice — your father will know. the producer cajoles jack: you're a jazz singer at heart!\n",
      "at the theater, the opening night audience is told that there will be no performance. jack sings the kol nidre in his father's place. his father listens from his deathbed to the nearby ceremony and speaks his last, forgiving words: mama, we have our son again. the spirit of jack's father is shown at his side in the synagogue. mary has come to listen. she sees how jack has reconciled the division in his soul: a jazz singer—singing to his god.\n",
      "the season passes—and time heals—the show goes on. jack, as the jazz singer, is now appearing at the winter garden theater, apparently as the featured performer opening for a show called back room. in the front row of the packed theater, his mother sits alongside yudleson. jack, in blackface, performs the song my mammy for her and for the world.\n",

      "jesus is also shown resurrecting lazarus and healing the little children. some humor is derived when one girl asks if he can heal broken legs, and, when he says yes, she gives him a legless doll. jesus smiles and repairs the doll. the crucifixion is foreshadowed when jesus, having helped a poor family, wanders through the father's carpentry shop, and, himself a carpenter's son, he briefly helps carve a piece of wood. when a sheet covering the object is removed, it is revealed to be a cross towering over jesus.\n",
      "jesus and his apostles enter jerusalem, where judas incites the people and rallies them to proclaim jesus king of the jews. jesus, however, renounces all claims of being an earthly king. caiaphas the high priest is also angry at judas for having led people to a man whom he sees as a false prophet. meanwhile, jesus drives away satan, who had offered him an earthly kingdom, and he protects a woman caught in adultery. the words he draws in the sand are revealed to be the sins the accusers themselves committed.\n",
      "judas, desperate to save himself from caiaphas, agrees to turn over jesus. noticeably at the last supper, when jesus distributes the bread and wine saying that they are his body and blood, judas refuses to eat. judas puts the cup to his lips but refuses to drink; he tears off a piece of bread but lets it drop to the ground. towards the end, mary confronts her son and tells him to flee from the danger that is coming. jesus replies that it must be done for the salvation of all peoples. they leave the room but the camera focuses on the table upon which a dove alights for a moment.\n",

      "jesus is taken away to be crucified, though he pauses on the via dolorosa to heal a group of cripples in an alley, despite his weakened condition. jesus is crucified and his enemies throw insults at him. (one woman even anachronistically eats popcorn and smiles with glee at jesus' crucifixion.) when jesus does die, however, a great earthquake comes up. the tree where judas had hanged himself, with the rope used to bind jesus's wrists, is swallowed up amidst gouts of hellfire. the sky turns black, lightning strikes, the wind blows, the people who had mocked jesus run in terror, and the veil covering the holy of holies in the jerusalem temple is torn in two.\n",
      "the tumult ends when mary looks up at heaven and asks god to forgive the world for the death of their son. the chaos ends and the sun shines. jesus is taken down from the cross and is buried. on the third day, he rises from the dead as promised. to emphasize the importance of the resurrection, this scene from an otherwise black and white film is shot in color. jesus goes to the apostles and tells them to spread his message to the world. he tells them i am with you always as the scene shifts to a modern city to show that jesus still watches over his followers.\n",

      "five years later, with the case still unresolved, a sinister-looking man with pointed teeth wearing a beaver-skin top hat, arrives at the household accompanied by a cadaverous-looking woman in a long gown; the arrival of these two individuals prompts sir james hamlin, the friend and neighbour of the late roger balfour, to call scotland yard. this in turn prompts inspector burke to travel to the household, where he discovers that three individuals now present in the household had been the only three who had been present five years previously when roger balfour had died. initially, burke remains sceptical that any of these three individuals (balfour's daughter, lucille, his butler williams, and arthur hibbs,[12] the nephew/secretary of the neighbour who had placed the call to scotland yard) may have been involved in his murder, until balfour's body disappears from its tomb and an individual looking distinctly like him is seen around the old balfour estate. this, in addition to other eerie acts such as instances of singular gunshots being heard in roger balfour's former bedroom occurring in the household while burke is there and the sinister-looking man in the beaver hat repeatedly terrifying those within the household, prompts him to determine to identify balfour's killer by reproducing the former crime scene and using hypnosis to induce the culprit into re-enacting the murder.[10][11][13][13][13][13]\n",

      "A common convention in the early decades of newspaper and magazine film reviews was to describe in the write-up the entire storyline including, in a substantial number of instances, the ending, thus unintentionally enabling subsequent generations of readers to reconstruct a lost film's contents. true to form, those who evaluated seven faces, such as mordaunt hall of the new york times,[6] did go into considerable detail regarding plot twists, as related herein below.[7][8][9][10]\n",
      "papa chibou (paul muni), the elderly caretaker of musée pratouchy, a parisian wax museum, feels a strong kinship with the figures, particularly with that of napoleon. he spots at the waxworks a romantic young couple, georges (russell gleason), a lawyer, and helene (marguerite churchill), the daughter of a stern judge (lester lonergan) who disapproves of his daughter's choice and forbids her to see georges. papa chibou suggests to them that they can still stay in touch, without disobeying her father's directive not to speak with each other, by placing secret personal messages in the pockets of napoleon's uniform. however, a missing letter and confusion in communication causes georges to arrive at the mistaken conclusion that helene has redirected her affections towards a foolish young man (walter rogers), who is unworthy of her and excessively preoccupied with his stylish personal appearance and elegant clothing.\n",
      "seeing their lovers' quarrel, papa chibou attempts to mollify the heated language, but george and helene rebuff his soothing words by telling him not to interfere, since as an old man he knows nothing of love. saddened by this rejection, he dreamily imagines that seven of the museum's waxworks come to life and offer philosophical advice on the intricacies of courtship and love. don juan, the legendary 17th century libertine, napoleon (1769–1821),[11] franz schubert (1797–1828), african american boxer joe gans (1874–1910),[12] willie smith, a cockney costermonger who became a music hall attraction after winning a lottery-auction known as calcutta sweepstakes[13] and a parisian hypnotist whose purported mastery of dark arts earned him the stage name diablero (all portrayed by muni) as well as catherine the great (1729–1796) (portrayed by salka stenermann) speak to papa chibou, each in his or her own unique manner and accent, providing insight and personal experience in their reflections on this very intimate topic.[14][15]\n",
      "the wax museum is unable to support itself and has to close. the owner, monsieur pratouchy (gustav von seyffertitz) puts the figures up for auction and papa chibou bids his life savings to acquire napoleon, but is outbid. he then decides to take the waxwork and, while struggling to carry the heavy and unwieldy life-size figure in his arms through paris streets, attracts public attention and is arrested for theft.\n",
      "at his trial, the judge is helene's father, while the defense attorney is georges, the young romantic, who delivers an impassioned summation vividly describing how the defendant was overcome by patriotic fervor over napoleon's victories and his contributions to the glory and grandeur of his beloved france. although the judge finds papa chibou guilty, as required by law, he is so impressed that he suspends the punishment and contributes towards the purchase price of the figure which is given to papa chibou who then confesses that as an uneducated man he never knew that napoleon had accomplished all those great deeds and that he simply formed a close attachment to him. then who did you think napoleon was, he is asked. a sort of murderer, he replies.[16] at that point, as he straightens napoleon's pockets, papa chibou discovers the overlooked letter which explains and resolves georges' and helene's misunderstanding, thus allowing the young lovers an opportunity to declare their true feelings, with her father's blessing.\n",

      "The credits (accompanied by organ music endemic to silent films), segue into title card: a city street-----where laughter and tragedy rub elbows. a crowded block lined with tenement buildings, on manhattan's lower east side, comes into view, followed by a look into the hallway of one of those buildings, then a shot is heard, a door to one of the apartments opens and a man holding a gun (paul muni) backs out, closes the door, puts the gun in his pocket, then walks down flights of stairs and into the busy street. while he passes along sidewalks teeming with human activity, an irish american policeman berates a driver for parking in front of a hydrant, but when the driver removes his scarf, revealing a clerical collar, the abashed officer apologizes and offers to accompany the priest to the beat of that cop on the next corner, he's not one of us. at that point, the shooter approaches and makes a gesture to speak, but the priest has already started to drive off, with the officer standing on the car's running board. continuing to walk, the shooter reaches a police precinct and goes inside. approaching the desk lieutenant (clifford dempsey), who asks, well, what's on your mind?, he replies, i killed a man, explaining that the victim lived at 191 east 8th street, was named john harris, and deserved to die. asked for his own name, he hesitates and, spotting a wall calendar (showing may 1928) with a large ad for dyke & co., inc., says dyke... james dyke. to why are you giving yourself up?, he answers it was the only thing to do.\n",
      "the subsequent title card states: civilization demands its toll. in court, the killer is only willing to explain that i never struck anybody in anger in all my life, but when i knew what he had done, i had to kill him. the judge (henry kolker) ultimately proclaims that it is the duty of this court to sentence you to be executed at the state's prison during the week of august seventeenth.\n",
      "another title card: meanwhile------in a far-away home.... in the backyard of a countryside house, a young woman (marguerite churchill) is attending to her dogs, while her wheelchair-bound mother (edith yorke) is sitting nearby. a young man (john mack brown) arrives and greets the mother as mrs. douglas, while she addresses him as robert and tells him that it was on such a nice day as this that she last saw her son joe. robert hands her your columbus paper and goes to greet the young woman, mary, who calls him bob. he unsuccessfully attempts to help mary bathe one of the dogs and, when she falls trying to catch the dog, bob impulsively kisses her and then proposes. mary's mother calls and shows them a photograph of james dyke in the paper with the lead condemned man's story of his life as it should have been. a lesson to youth on folly of crime by the man of mystery. she tells them that he looks like the long lost joe, but mary says that it must be a mistake and there's happy news in that bob proposed and after the marriage they will all live together.\n",
      "the next title card describes gray walls, claiming their forfeits of liberty------and life. prisoners are seen laboring in a field outside the prison and, as they return to the mess hall for a meal, a stage above the dining area features an orchestra consisting of african american prisoners, replete with a smiling bandleader, playing dance music for the prisoners as they eat. dyke is brought to the office of the warden (dewitt jennings) who asks him about any family members whom he might like to contact, but the condemned man replies that he has no one. leaving the office, he hears the jaunty melodies resonating from the dining area and says, i didn't know you had music... here. a newspaper's printing machines are seen churning out the evening edition with the headings: mystery of dyke's identity secret as hour of death nears. prisoner staunchly refuses to divulge secret of himself or the motive for his crime though he faces chair. james dyke maintains silence as he writes news paper articles warning youth on the folly of crime. one of the printers (unbilled robert homans) tells the other that he heard the paper was paying dyke $2,500 for his writings and that dyke was buying liberty bonds with the money.\n",

      "a title card indicates the test of the valiant. dyke is escorted to the warden who commends his exemplary behavior and asks what he wants done with the $2,500 in liberty bonds which are being held here in the office for him. dyke replies that he'll think of something. also present is the chaplain (richard carlyle) who, along with the warden, tries to convince him to see the young lady who traveled a thousand miles to speak with him in the hope that he might be her long-lost brother. dyke eventually agrees, but requests privacy for the meeting, which is granted. the warden initially speaks with mary alone, learning that she is from the (fictitious) town of pennington in ohio, that her father died when she was a baby, that joe, who is ten years older, left home fifteen years ago because he wanted to be in the city and has not been heard from since. she is certain, however, that she could recognize him from his reactions to their long-ago goodnight verses from romeo and juliet.\n",
      "as dyke is brought into the office, the warden, the chaplain and the guard exit, leaving the two alone, but with all doors open. after mary's explanation, dyke denies being her brother, says he is from canada, not ohio, and does not react to the verses. as mary is about to leave, however, he asks her to repeat her name and her brother's name and then tells her that when he served with the canadian forces during the war (world war i), a fellow showed great valor in sacrificing his life and the dead hero's name was joseph anthony douglas. there will be a record of his service, but as occasionally happens in war, other details, including his ultimate fate, may be lost. however, she should take the unopened envelope (containing the liberty bonds) to her mother and buy for her a gold star to put on the front door in honor of her fallen son. mary asks if there is anything she can do and he responds that her touch would mean the world to him.\n",
      "after hugging him, mary leaves with the envelope and then james dyke softly recites to himself the sleep dwell upon thine eyes lines as the time for his execution arrives. back in pennington, mary and bob sit by the piano, while mrs. douglas rests in her wheelchair on the porch, visualizing marching doughboys and then her young son's smiling face while he is also wearing such a uniform. as bob and mary wheel her inside, the front door slowly swings closed, revealing the display of a large star.\n",

      "Professor kantorek gives an impassioned speech about the glory of serving in the army and saving the fatherland. on the brink of becoming men, the boys in his class, led by paul baumer, are moved to join the army as the new 2nd company. their romantic delusions are quickly broken during their brief but rigorous training under the abusive corporal himmelstoss, who bluntly informs them, you're going to be soldiers—and that's all.\n",
      "the new soldiers arrive by train at the combat zone, which is mayhem, with soldiers everywhere, incoming shells, horse-drawn wagons racing about, and prolonged rain. one in the group is killed before the new recruits can reach their post, to the alarm of one of the new soldiers (behn). the new soldiers are assigned to a unit composed of older soldiers, who are not exactly accommodating. the young soldiers find that there is no food available at the moment. they have not eaten since breakfast, but the men they have joined have not had food for two days. one of them, kat katczinsky, had gone to locate something to eat and he returns with a slaughtered hog he has stolen from a field kitchen. the young soldiers pay for their dinner with soaps and cigarettes.\n",
      "the new recruits' first trip to the trenches with the veterans, to re-string barbed wire, is a harrowing experience, especially when behn is blinded by shrapnel and hysterically runs into machine-gun fire. after spending several days in a bunker under bombardment, they at last move into the trenches and successfully repulse an enemy attack; they then counterattack and take an enemy trench with heavy casualties, but have to abandon it. they are sent back to the field kitchens to get their rations; each man receives double helpings, simply because of the number of dead.\n",
      "the men start out eating greedily, but then settle into a satiated torpor. they hear that they are to return to the front the next day and begin a semi-serious discussion about the causes of the war and of wars in general. they speculate about whether geographical entities offend each other and whether these disagreements involve them. tjaden speaks familiarly about himself and the kaiser; kat jokes that instead of having a war, they should have the leaders of europe be stripped to their underwear and fight it out with clubs.\n",
      "one day, corporal himmelstoss arrives to the front and is immediately spurned because of his bad reputation; he is forced to go over the top with the 2nd company and is promptly killed. in an attack on a cemetery, paul stabs a french soldier, but finds himself trapped in a hole with the dying man for an entire night. throughout the night, he desperately tries to help him, bringing him water, but fails miserably to stop him from dying. he cries bitterly and begs the dead body to speak so he can be forgiven. later, he returns to the german lines and is comforted by kat.\n",
      "going back to the front line, paul is severely wounded and taken to a catholic hospital, along with his good friend albert kropp. kropp's leg is amputated, but he does not find out until some time afterwards. around this time, paul is taken to the bandaging ward, from which, according to its reputation, nobody has ever returned alive; but he later returns to the normal rooms triumphantly, only to find kropp in depression.\n",
      "paul is given a furlough and visits his family at home. he is shocked by how uninformed everyone is about the actual situation of the war; everyone is convinced that a final push for paris is soon to occur. when paul visits the schoolroom where he was originally recruited, he finds professor kantorek prattling the same patriotic fervor to a class of even younger students. professor kantorek asks of paul to detail his experience, to which the latter reveals that war was not at all like he had envisioned and mentions the deaths of his partners; this revelation upsets the professor, as well as the young students who promptly call paul a coward. disillusioned and angry, paul returns to the front and comes upon another 2nd company that is filled with new young recruits who are now disillusioned; he is then happily greeted by tjaden. he goes to find kat, and they discuss the inability of the people to comprehend the futility of the war. kat's shin is broken when a bomb dropped by an aircraft falls nearby, so paul carries him back to a field hospital - only to find that kat has been killed by a second explosion. crushed by the loss of his mentor, paul leaves.\n",

      "the next day, a police squad arrives to secure the house and search for the missing painting. realizing that they may have gone too far, mrs. whitehead and grace ask hives for the beaugard he took back, but he can't find it anywhere. mrs. whitehead deduces the professor must have stolen it. after confronting him she gets grace's copy back. later, john finds grace's copy of the beaugard and reveals to arabella that someone else must have had the same idea as them. realizing that chandler never actually saw john's copy, they become more hopeful. soon after john realizes the copy he found is now missing. capt. spaulding, jameson, and ravelli discuss how they might go about finding the missing painting. after getting the painting back from the professor, who is now in disguise, john and arabella bring it to capt. spaulding. they figure out that the professor must be the one who stole the paintings, and enlist the police to help find him.\n",

      "vance and the others repeatedly interview dillard and his friends and neighbors. living with dillard is his niece belle; dillard's adopted son, sigurd arnesson, who is also belle's boyfriend, returns from college on hearing of the crime. in the next house are the drukkers, a brother and sister: she feels responsible for a serious injury he still suffers from, and is now very frail and agoraphobic. she says she saw nothing of the crime; her brother says he heard her screaming in her room, which she denies. he also admits to being in dillard's house before the murder. another neighbor is john pardee, a chess enthusiast, who seems to be overly interested in the case.\n",
      "a taunting typewritten note is found, signed the bishop. it alludes to the nursery rhyme cock robin: robin was nicknamed cock robin, and another visitor at the house that day was named sperling—german for sparrow. however, sperling eventually proves to have a solid alibi. dillard has no typewriter in the house, and neither drukker's nor bishop's matches the note.\n",
      "later a friend of arnesson's, named john, is found murdered. he was shot in the top of the head, apparently in allusion to jack's injury in the rhyme jack and jill. then drukker, sitting on a low wall in a park at night, is pulled off the wall and murdered. the bishop continues sending notes about each crime, connecting the last one to humpty dumpty. drukker's sister is found dead also, perhaps from fright, and a valuable notebook about his research work is missing from their home. a chess bishop has been left in her hand.\n",
      "heath and markham become suspicious of pardee and go to arrest him, but find him dead. next to his body, obviously built after he died, is a house of cards with a chess bishop on top: it is this is the house that jack built. later, dillard expresses some misgivings about arnesson, and mentions the henrik ibsen play the pretenders, which arnesson is fond of.\n",
      "that night, after belle says goodnight to arnesson, she makes her way into the attic and finds the typewriter that the bishop used for his notes. at this point she is jumped from behind.\n",
      "mulling over dillard's words later that night, vance suddenly realizes that one of the characters in the pretenders is a bishop—named arnesson. he rushes back to dillard's house together with markham, heath, and more police. arnesson's window is open and neither he nor belle is in their room. dillard joins the group to search the house, breaking down the locked door to the attic. there they find the typewriter, but not belle, who is lying bound and gagged in a nearby cupola.\n",
      "downstairs, they are talking to dillard when arnesson returns. when vance accuses him, he acts guilty. meanwhile dillard surreptitiously pours some powder from a compartment in his ring into a wine glass. as things calm down and arnesson is about to be arrested, dillard offers him a glass, then pours more wine for himself; but vance announces that he has switched the glasses.\n",
      "dillard is the murderer, and was trying to fake arnesson's suicide. he wanted to be belle's only friend. he originally only intended to kill robin and frame arnesson, but developed the more elaborate scheme when he realized miss drukker must have witnessed his actions. vance had tipped arnesson to act guilty, and had heath search the cupola after dillard left the attic; belle is fine.\n",
      "arnesson and belle embrace, and vance stops heath from carelessly drinking the poison.\n"

      "while juan is alone at the flat, enrique tracks juan down, ready to kill him. although they initially argue about the situation with maria, enrique, with a little help from lola, is able to convince juan to send maria back to the convent, as his act of love is stealing her away from her vow to god, and that she would always be seen as harlot if they were to get married, thus sending her to eternal damnation. knowing that maria will not go willingly, juan convinces maria that he no longer loves her as he has reconciled with lola. a tearful maria, now believing the outside world is evil as enrique once said, leaves with her brother back to seville and san agustín.\n",

      "helen (played by eleanor boardman), like most daughters who marry wealthy villains in melodramas, does so to save her father from ruin. there is a flash of the wedding and soon helen and her ignoble husband are seen aboard the steamship bound for east africa. on the same vessel is karl von reiden, the officer who is to take charge of the neu posen post. he is not averse to a little flirtation with a beautiful woman and therefore when helen goes out on deck to avoid bolte, karl succeeds in meeting her. these scenes are fairly well filmed and the color effects are capital. karl, played by ralph forbes, is a handsome fellow. so soon as he knows that bolte is helen's husband he realizes that the marriage is not to her liking. later these passengers are on the river boat, and when that craft reaches neu posen. bolte stands on the aft deck hoping to make all the german officers envious of his attractive bride. he later gives a feast and takes good care to make a show of his wealth, even to having a procession of natives carrying the viands.\n",
      "a visit from a native woman interrupts the proceedings, and in a subsequent passage bolte, enraged with his wife, is about to flog her with a whip when karl comes to the rescue. all this happens just prior to the world war, and in the closing chapters word is received by both the germans and the british that hostilities have been declared. bolte, the snake, believes that money can buy his freedom from military service, but soon he learns otherwise. he is compelled to don a uniform and then decides to run away. his end is sudden, for he fires at one group of natives without knowing that others are behind him. they know something about bolte and his pleas for his life fall on deaf ears. there follow episodes in which karl goes to the rescue of helen and others, who are in danger of an attack by the natives. these are pictured with due attention for red blood on the hero's shirt. it seems that the britishers might have been more solicitous about karl's wounds, but all the british commandant says when he comes up to karl is to ask him whether he will have another piccadilly cigarette.\n"
